# I'm Wesley Bertipaglia ðŸ‘‹

I'm a 24-year-old web developer based in Brazil. I find joy in the ever-evolving world of technology, constantly exploring and playing with different tech stacks to keep things exciting.

## Working

By day, I'm immersed in the world of full-stack web development, particularly in the realm of JavaScript and .NET. I love the challenge of crafting digital experiences and bringing ideas to life through code.

## Having fun

When I'm not coding, you'll often find me with headphones on, immersed in the soothing vibes of lofi music.

Feel free to explore my personal website to get a glimpse of my work and interests. If you share a love for technology, music, or just want to connect, don't hesitate to reach out. Let's build something amazing together! ðŸš€
